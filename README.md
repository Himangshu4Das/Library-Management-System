# Library-Management-System
The following project implements various operations of object oriented programming.

Run the app.py for main application.
my_functions.py contains various methods for management of book details.
Book.py contains book class.

NOTE: The code uses os.system("cls") to refresh the screen after every operation is completed for the user. This might not work on linux.
      Therefore try replacing "clear" inplace of "cls".
